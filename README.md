# pft: Particle Filtering Tracking Demo
Copyright (c) 2019 Bart Massey

This Python 3 code demonstrates Bayesian Particle Filtering
(BPF) to track a simulated vehicle. The simulation is in its
very early stages and needs a lot of work to be physically
plausible.

At the end of a simulation, an animation showing the
inferred position (blue dot), actual position (red dot), and
particle positions (green dots) will be displayed.
